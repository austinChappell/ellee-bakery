          <p class="question">Do they taste as good as they look?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes! At Ellee Bakery, we use a shortbread-type cookie with royal icing. The cookie itself is not very sweet, but the icing is. The combination of the two make a perfectly balanced, soft and crumbly cookie.</p>
          <p class="question">How long do the cookies last?</p>
          <p class="answer">The shelf life for these cookies is about 2 weeks. Refrigerating or freezing can prolong the shelf life for a few weeks or several months, respectively. However, Ellee Bakery recommends they be consumed within 1 week for the best taste.</p>
          <p class="question">Do you sell vegan, or gluten/dairy/nut free cookies?</p>
          <p class="answer">At this time, Ellee Bakery is only able to accommodate nut free cookies. Almond extract is used in our primary recipe, but this can be withheld upon request.</p>
          <p class="answer">We will soon be venturing into providing gluten free cookies, so please feel free to contact us if you have an interest in a gluten free option. It is important to know that, as someone with family members who have Celiac disease, Ellee Bakery is familiar with the risks of cross-contamination and every precaution would be taken to prevent this from occurring; however, we are not a gluten-free kitchen.</p>

          <p class="question">Why are these cookies so expensive? They are just cookies!</p>
          <p class="answer">At Ellee Bakery, the vast majority of cookies are made to order and hand-decorated. Designing, baking, and decorating is a labor intensive process requiring a minimum of 2-3 hours for basic designs and can take up 12 hours or more for elaborate designs. The average time it takes to prep, bake, decorate, and package a dozen detailed cookies is around 7-8 hours. The attention to detail and custom designs are what sets Ellee Bakery cookies apart from your average cookie.</p>
          <p class="question">What do you mean when you say “basic,” “detailed,” or “elaborate” designs?</p>
          <p class="answer">These terms primarily refer to the amount of piping/time that goes into decoration a cookie. Usually it can be broken down by how many colors/consistencies are involved:
            <ul>
              <li>Basic: 1-2 colors and consistencies of icing, minimal piping</li>
              <li>Detailed: 4-6 colors and consistencies of icing, simple details</li>
              <li>Elaborate: 7 or more colors of icing, several piped details</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="question">How do I order?</p>
          <p class="answer">Please see the “Order” page to fill out an order request form. Upon receiving the form, we will contact you within 1-2 business days to give you a quote and to request confirmation of the order. To confirm the order a 50% deposit is required.</p>
          <p class="question">How do I pay?</p>
          <p class="answer">A 50% deposit is required for all orders at the time of order confirmation via PayPal or Venmo. The other 50% is due via cash or check at the time of pick up/delivery.</p>
          <p class="question">Is there a minimum order?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes, one dozen cookies are required for a minimum order.</p>
          <p class="question">How far in advance do I need to place my order?</p>
          <p class="answer">Standard orders need to be place 14 days prior to the date of pick up.</p>
          <p class="question">Is there any way I can order some cookies for an event this weekend?</p>
          <p class="answer">Possibly. Ellee Bakery may be able to accommodate your rush order for an additional charge. However, it depends on the order. Please <a href="http://www.elleebakery.com/contact/">contact us</a> right away with “Rush Order Request” in the subject line.</p>

          <p class="question">Where do I pick up my order?</p>
          <p class="answer">The primary pickup location is in Red Oak, Texas. Further details will be provided upon order confirmation.</p>
          <p class="question">Do you deliver?</p>
          <p class="answer">After hours delivery (evenings and weekends) is available in special circumstances for a fee. Any delivery must be within a 25 mile radius of Red Oak, Texas. In addition to this, there are alternate pick up locations in Dallas/Mesquite/Frisco/Denton on set days for holiday orders. Please feel free to message Ellee Bakery via the <a href="http://www.elleebakery.com/contact/">Contact Us</a> page with any questions about delivery or alternate pick up locations.</p>
          <p class="question">Can I purchase an order and have it delivered by mail?</p>
          <p class="answer">Texas cottage bakery laws are designed to promote local, face-to-face interactions between customers and the person making their food. Unfortunately, this doesn’t allow for orders to be delivered by mail.</p>
          <p class="question">Can my business purchase whole sale from Ellee Bakery to resell in our store/restaurant?</p>
          <p class="answer">Not at this time. Ellee Bakery currently operates under Texas cottage bakery laws, which requires all sales be made directly to the customer. The only possible exception to this is donation or sales to a non-profit event.</p>
          <p class="question">Will you cater an event?</p>
          <p class="answer">For an additional fee and special circumstances, such as a wedding, yes. Please use our <a href="http://www.elleebakery.com/contact/">Contact Us</a> page for any inquiries about catering.</p>
